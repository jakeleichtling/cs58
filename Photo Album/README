Photo Album

Compilation and Cleanup:
    - To compile the program, run "$ make"
    - To compile the program for debugging, run "$ make gdb"
    - To delete the compilation output, run "$ make clean"
    - To do a full cleanup (delete compilation output, text editor autosave output, output jpg files,
            and index.html), run "$ make clean_all"

Running:
    To run the program, invoke the executable PhotoAlbum from any directory, passing it
    0 or more image file paths.

Testing:
    To test the program, I invoked the executable and passed it
    the file paths of copies of the images found in
    "tahoe.cs.dartmouth.edu:/net/class/cs58/private_html/internal/work/proj1/photos/".
    For each photo, I rotated it such that it would be right-side-up in the output, and I recorded
    the selected rotation option in the image caption. I then ensured that
    index.html and the files it linked to corresponded to the expected output.

    When entering input, I tested invalid user behavior by entering out of range choice integers,
    non-integer choices, and empty lines. I also invoked the program with arguments pointing
    to non-existent files and ensured that it failed in the expected manner.
